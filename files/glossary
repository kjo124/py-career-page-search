Distributed System Programming Concepts
Software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.

OOP Programming Paradigms
Stands for object-oriented programming. Programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects' (which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields) often known as attributes; and code (in the form of procedures) often known as methods.

See also: POP

Functional programming Programming Paradigms
Style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

DevOps DevOps
Development + Operations. Software development method that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration and automation. The method acknowledges the interdependence of software development, QA, and IT operations, and aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services and to improve operations performance.

SOLID Software Architecture
An abbreviation for the 'first five principles' of OOD and OOP. These basic principles help to create good software architecture. SOLID – SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP.

See also: OOD, OOP

RESTful API Software Architecture
An API that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. A RESTful API breaks down a transaction to create a series of small modules. Each module addresses a particular underlying part of the transaction.

Database Databases
A collection of digital information, that is organized in such a way that it can be easily managed. The information is stored and processed on a computer with or without human assistance. Traditional databases are organized by areas, records, and files.

SSL DevOps
Secure Sockets Layer is a technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. The SSL certificate begins to encrypt any data that comes from the client computer to your server. At the same time, the usual link in the HTTP browser turns into HTTPS, where "s" means secure-protected.

See also: HTTP, https

JSON Software Architecture
JavaScript Object Notation is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. A way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. Gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.

See also: AJAX, jQuery, XML

XML Software Architecture
Extensible Markup Language is a language with a simple formal syntax, convenient for creating and processing documents by programs and at the same time convenient for reading and creating documents by a person.

See also: HTML, JSON, XAML

REST Software Architecture
Representational State Transfer is an architectural style of the interaction of components of the distributed application in a network. REST is an agreed set of constraints.

See also: GraphQL, RESTful API, SOAP

Git Tools
A lightweight and fast distributed VCS for small and large projects alike, which it handles with the same efficiency. Git handles all changes via a series of commands. It also provides support for nonlinear, distributed workflows.

Gradle Back-end
Build tool that does not use XML for build script, instead it provides a domain specific language (DSL). This DSL is based on groovy, another JVM compatible language. Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Apache Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Apache Maven

See also: Maven, XML

JavaScript Front-end
A client-side scripting language primarily used to make web pages interactive. In other words, it's responsible for the 'behavior' of a website, i.e. how HTML elements and CSS style animate and move around on the page.

See also: CSS, DOM, HTML

Maven Back-end
Project management and comprehension tool that provides developers a complete build life cycle framework. Development team can automate the project's build infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build life cycle.

sbt Back-end
Scala Build Tool. An alternative to ANT and Maven made with Scala in mind. Its main features is native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks.

See also: Gradle, Maven

Front-end Front-end
Front-end is a term that involves the building of webpages and user interfaces for web-applications. It implements the structure, design, behavior, and animation of everything you see on the screen when you open up websites, web applications, or mobile apps.

Scala Back-end
Modern and powerful programming language invented in Switzerland. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of Java.

See also: Elixir, Go, Rust

Back-end General Terms
Or the 'server-side' of website development. Basically it is the programming that users don’t see in the browser, but what also powers the website. Back-end facilitates communication between the browser and server, provides smooth functionality akin to a desktop application.

See also: Database

RequireJS Front-end
JavaScript file and module loader that helps load the scripts and manage dependencies between them. Optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node.

UML Software Architecture
Unified Modeling Language is a standardized modeling language used to specify, visualize, construct, and document models of software systems, including their structure and design.

Google Drive Tools
A cloud-based file storage, that includes basic Office suite tools: Docs, Sheets, Slides, and others. It provides features for sharing and editing documents in collaboration with other Google Drive users, public and private or limited access. More features can be added via Add-ons.
